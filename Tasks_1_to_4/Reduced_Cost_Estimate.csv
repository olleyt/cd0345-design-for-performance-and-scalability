Note on changes: ,,,,,,,,
,"After monitoring the solution architecture for cost optimization, we found that we can scale down App Servers from (m6gd.16xlarge) to (t4g.2xlarge) instance type",,,,,,,
,"In addition,  database instances were optimized from (db.r4.4xlarge) to  as (db.r4.4xlarge) was over-provisioned capacity well above the actual demand",,,,,,,
,Further budget reductions are possible with switching to database reserved isntances and  EC2 savings plans / reserved instances ,,,,,,,
